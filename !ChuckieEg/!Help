Jump  - Space
Hold  - H

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Inside the game application directory is a configuration file named !Config. Loading this into a text editor will allow you to change the game options.
Initially, the options are set to:

Lives=5
Level=0

Changing the value after the equals sign (=) will allow you to change the number of lives and the initial level you start with.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------

This game will run on all RISC OS computers from RISC OS 3.5 to StrongARM,
RISC OS 4, 5, 6 and 7, and RISC OS 64.

It has been actively tested on RISC OS Select, RISC OS 7 and RISC OS 64.


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

Runs rather slowly; might be due to excess use of VSyncs.

AArch64 version:

* Does not support file access for the scores and key layouts.
* Must be run directly, rather than through the application.
